# Text For The LSAMP Bioinformatics Workshop at RCC

This is an open source, open educational resource (OER) text that I am  developing for the LSAMP Bioinformatics Workshop at RCC[Roxbury Community College](http://www.rcc.mass.edu) in Boston, Massachusetts. This introductory course provides an introduction to the principles of genetics and its applications with a focus on the molecular basis of heredity and the role of genes and genomes in health and disease, development and evolution.

On the technology side, I got started by cloning Yihui Xie's [rstudio/bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) site. I discovered bookdown because after reading Garrett Grolemund's and Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), which is a pleasure to read on any screen including the mobile phone.

The current current version of this text is available [here](https://nikolaussucher.github.io/bioinformatics/).
